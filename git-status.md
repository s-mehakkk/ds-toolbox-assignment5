# Definition: git status

The git status command is an essential tool in a developer's toolkit, providing immediate, detailed feedback on the state of the working directory and the staging area within a Git repository. It shows which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This command is particularly useful for preparing precise commits by allowing developers to review their changes before committing them to the repository's history.

In the JupyterLab IDE, similar information to what git status provides can be accessed through the Git integration interface. JupyterLab's Git extension visually indicates files' statuses in the Git panel, showing changes, additions, and untracked files within the project's directory, thus offering an intuitive, graphical approach to managing version control operations without the need for terminal commands.
